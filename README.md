* Project Description
   * This is the rewritten version of my original shibi-collector game. I wrote it in React.js, and utilised React Bootstrap, which is something I learned for this project. The concept of the game is to add up enough numbers to meet the current target. Each shibi avatar is assigned a random number every time the game resets.
